             <p>
                Greetings, future Pokémon Trainers! Welcome to the Pokémon License Generator, home to the official Department of Pokémon Trainers (DPT). Here is where your journey as an accredited Pokémon Trainer truly begins! This is your one-stop destination to obtain the prestigious Pokémon Trainer License—the golden ticket that grants you the right to own, care for, and train Pokémon.

                Becoming a certified Trainer is no small feat. Aspiring Trainers must meet specific requirements before embarking on their Pokémon adventures. Only those who have proven their dedication, passed all examinations, and met the age requirement of at least ten years old are eligible. Once approved, Trainers will receive their official license, granting them the authority to purchase Poké Balls and build a team of beloved Pokémon companions.

                Here at the DPT, we celebrate your commitment and provide you with an easy way to claim your hard-earned Trainer License. Ready to make it official? Simply fill out the form and take your rightful place among the proud ranks of certified Pokémon Trainers. Please be advised that by filling out this form, your information will be stored in our PokeTrainer Database. 

                Your adventure awaits—so don't keep your future Pokémon partners waiting!
